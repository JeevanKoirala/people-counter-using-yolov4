# people-counter-using-yolov4
this project is meant to count the people in the image,video or from live cam..
this project uses the yolov4 weights and coco names and things like that....

the weights are heavy and takes time to download so dont worry have patience they will get downloaded and run and the project wasn't running the second time so AI suggested me to make the model redownload everytime so i did that for some work i have used AI cause everything wasn't available in the internet at first i had used the yolov4 tiny but didn't worked and i had to switch to the yolo v4 so it took a long time and you guys can just copy the repo and use it its fine
